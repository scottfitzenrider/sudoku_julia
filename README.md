# sudoku_julia
Solves a sudoku puzzle from a text file.

This is just an exercise to teach myself the julia language

Create a text file with one line for each line of the sudoku puzzle
using 0 (zero) for blanks.

for example *expert.txt* is the following:
```
000006800
060000040
809000080
000800002
106300000
000020700
008000010
900000007
045900080
```
to run:

`julia Sudoku.jl <sudoku file name>`
